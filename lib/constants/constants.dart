    'This is thought to happen as a result of body structures not developing normally.'

    'They burn calories at a slower rate and are frequently diagnosed with an under-active thyroid which can contribute to weight gain.'
    'Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is common among children with Down syndrome.Symptoms include heartburn, '
    'sore throat,'
    ' regurgitation and chest pain.'
    'Gluten intolerance and celiac disease is also widespread and can lead to nutrient deficiency and an impaired immune system if dietary needs are avoided.Finally, '
    'periodontal disease becomes prevalent in adulthood so it is important to establish habits to eat foods that will decrease its likelihood.';
